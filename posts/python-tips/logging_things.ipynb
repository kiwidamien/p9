    "\n",
    "Here are the basic parts of logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **logger**: The is the the thing you make when calling `my_logger = getLogger(\"my_awesome_logger\")`. The logger is responsible for creating LogRecords, which is a data structure containing the information we want to log. It does this with a variety of methods: `my_logger.debug(\"message\")` creates a LogRecord with level DEBUG, etc. In addition, a logger contains the following parts:\n",
    "  * An internal level (numeric, but commonly aliased to DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) for the logger that can be set and changed.\n",
    "  * A filter, for determining which records \n",
    "  * A collection of handlers (see below)\n",
    "  * A propagation flag\n",
    "* **log records**: A log record is recreated when you call `my_logger.debug(message)`, `my_logger.info(message)`, etc. It creates a data structure that contains the message you gave it, as well as injecting a collection of metadata (e.g. when the message was called, what module it was called in, what function you were in, what line number you were on, what the level of the message is (debug vs info vs warning vs error vs critical), etc. The various fields you can access are listed in the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes).\n",
    "* **formatters**: A way of taking a log record, and turning into a string that can be printed, stored in a file, a database, etc.\n",
    "* **handlers**: A handler takes a log record, and decides what to do with it. Each handler typically deals with place to put logs, called a sink. If you wanted to print logs to std out and save them in a file, you would typically have two handlers: one handler for printing to std out, and a separate handler for each. A handler typically has\n",
    "  * An internal level (numeric, but commonly aliased to DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), just like the logger (this is a source of much confusion)\n",
    "  * A filter, for determining if this log record should be handled\n",
    "  * A formatter, which takes a log record and turns it into a string. This is the thing that is printed / stored in a file / stored in a database, etc.\n",
    "  * A sink: where we put the non-filtered strings we created from *log records*\n",

    "2. The logger then creates the LogRecord, which contains the message `\"my_message\"`, as well as other meta data (e.g. when the LogRecord was created, the module/function/line number of the call, etc).\n",
    "3. The logger then checks if the LogRecord should be filtered out. It has access to all the data in the log record, not just the level. If it should be filtered out, we stop here.\n",
    "4. The logger then passes the LogRecord to each handler. Each handler now goes through a similar set of steps:\n",
    "   * Each handler checks _it's_ level, to see if it is INFO or lower. The handler stops if it's level is higher than INFO.\n",
    "   * Each handler with level INFO or below sees if it should filter out this message (e.g. some records might be okay to go on a screen, but not saved to disk)\n",
    "   * For each handler with level INFO or below, that didn't filter out the message, then formats the message, and sends it to it's sink.\n",
    "5. The LogRecord is then propagated on to the parent logger of this logger (!!). \n",
    "   * If `my_logger` rejects the LogRecord, we stop on steps 1 or 3 -- we never get here. Being rejected by the logger means no propagation.\n",
    "   * If `my_logger` doesn't reject the LogRecord, we do this step after all the handlers for `my_logger` -- even if every handler for `my_logger` rejected the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-warning}\n",
    "Here are a couple of \"gotchas\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If you have a _handler_ with a level of DEBUG, but the logger has a higer level (e.g. INFO), you won't see any DEBUG messages. This is because the logger is dropping the messages before the handler gets a chance to see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If you have a logger that drops a message (by level or filter), it will _not_ be propagated to other loggers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - If the logger doesn't drop a message, it will be propagated, even if no logger handles it. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is if you wanted to block messages from Pandas, you only have to manipulate the logger to block at the logger e.g. to block Pandas DEBUG messages while keeping INFO and higher, but keep debug messages from your application, you would only need to set the LEVEL on the pandas logger to INFO, and the logger for your application to DEBUG.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in addition to multiple handlers, we also have multiple _loggers_. Let's deal with that next."
